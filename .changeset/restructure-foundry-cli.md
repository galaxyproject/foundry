Restructure publishable packages: introduce the unified `foundry` CLI bundling all `validate-*` subcommands plus a `summarize-nextflow` wrapper. The summarize-nextflow package now owns its own schema and self-validates without a foundry dependency. The four standalone schema packages (`summary-nextflow-schema`, `summary-cwl-schema`, `galaxy-tool-discovery-schema`, `galaxy-tool-summary-schema`, `tests-format-schema`) are folded into either `summarize-nextflow` (producer-co-located) or `foundry` (orphans).
